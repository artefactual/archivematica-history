Version 0.2.6 (8/6/09)
--------------------
- Fixed bug that prevented external identifiers from being output in <identity> sections

Version 0.2.5 (7/28/09)
---------------------
- Fixed GZIP identification output
- Fixed display-tool-output option so that all tool output is displayed
  instead of just the tools that reported a successful identification
- Exiftool mime of "application/unknown" is handled as an unknown identification (ICC files)
- All tools default unknown identification output is now normalized to 'Uknown Binary' and 
  'application/octet-stream'.
- Added a partial identification status when a tool finds only a mimetype or a format name.
  If no valid identities (mimetype and format) are returned by any tools, then tool output is 
  scanned according to the order defined in fits.xml for a partial identity (only a valid mimetype or format).
  If a partial identity is not found then the unknown identity returned by the first tool defined
  in fits.xml is used.
