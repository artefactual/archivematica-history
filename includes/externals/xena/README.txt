Xena is released under the General Public License version 3. A full copy of this license can be found in the accompanying file, 'COPYING.txt'.


Requirements
------------
To run this pre-compiled version of Xena you will require the open source Java stack, OpenJDK (http://openjdk.org) version 6.

To normalise certain file formats Xena relies on external programs, such as OpenOffice.org for Office documents. Please see Xena help from inside the program for more details.


Run Xena
--------
The Xena program itself is called 'xena.jar' and you should be able to start it by either executing the "xena.sh" shell script.

Else, you can also run Xena manually from the Xena directory, via the command line with:
  java -jar xena.jar

Please note that if running the script under Linux, first ensure that it is executable with:
  chmod a+x xena.sh

This should kick up the program.
Have fun!


Run Xena Viewer
---------------
Xena files you create will be 'plain text' XML files, with the metadata and content of the original file stored in Base64 encoding.

Use any text editor to view the raw content of the Xena file itself (XML). To view and extract the original or normalised content stored in the Xena files you have created, use the Xena Viewer.

To start the Xena Viewer, simply run the respective execution script for your operating system, similar to the Xena instructions above.

Else, you can start it manually from the Xena directory by running the following via the command line:
  java -cp xena.jar au.gov.naa.digipres.xena.viewer.ViewerMainFrame $1

For Windows, run:
  java -cp xena.jar au.gov.naa.digipres.xena.viewer.ViewerMainFrame %1

Have fun!
