Notes to get started:
install the dependancies. & python
edit the client and server to load local archivematica config file.
edit the archivematica config file locations to represent where they are located on your machine (replace /home/joseph/archivematica...)

The server may have a problem with watch folder .IN_CREATED 
if it does, switch the commented line, and it should work.

errors in moving the folder tend to crash the server (no try catch implemented yet)

dependancies:
sudo apt-get install python-twisted
sudo apt-get install python-pyinotify
archivematica Load Config


stdout and stderr should be relative to folder path /objects/
^disable "../" on client side <evil people>

FAQ
