Welcome to the SWORDAPP IMAP email example client!
--------------------------------------------------

This is an example SWORD deposit application that reads emails from an
IMAP mailbox, and deposits it. The person who sent the email is used as the
author, the subject line of the email used as the title, and the body of the
email is used as an abstract. Attached files are the deposited with the item.

A reply is sent to the sender of the email with the URL of the deposited item.

See configuration.php for the settings.

The application requires PHP to be configured with IMAP and the PECL mailparse
library. These are used to connect to the IMAP mailbox, and to parse the
email attachments. For best results, use plain text emails.

This application has been written by Stuart Lewis (stuart@stuartlewis.com).
Limited support is availble via the sword-app-tech email list:
