After numerous problems with unoconv, and generally undefined behavior, I decided to look for some alternatives.

I found these scripts @ http://www.oooninja.com/2008/02/batch-command-line-file-conversion-with.html

To run in archivematica... 
First open the oo port by running the OOconverter.sh
Then replace the unoconv.sh script in /transcoderScripts/ with this one.
Also move the DocumentConverter.py to the transcoderScripts directory.


After doing some testing I've found that it is subject to the segmentation faults and other problems I've seen with unoconv.
So these problems would be Open Office related.
I have not seen, the process hang; which was what was causing the MCP to hang.
