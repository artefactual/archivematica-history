Download and burn a DemoCD

ICA-AtoM is web-based software which requires a web server and database server 
to 
operate. However, we created the ICA-AtoM DemoCD to make it easy for you to demo 
the ICA-AtoM software on your own local computer. It is available for download 
at 
http://ica-atom.org/democd. You can burn and make as many CD copies as you like. 
The Demo CD will run on any computer. It temporarily loads the Ubuntu Linux 
operating system into memory, along with the necessary web server, database 
server, 
Firefox browser and ICA-AtoM application. When you are finished the demo, your 
computer restarts using your regular operating system and configuration.
