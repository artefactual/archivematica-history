FENNEL-CARAWAY SWEDISH LIMPE=09
5 to 5 1/2 cups all purpose flour
2 pkg. dry yeast
2 cups water
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tsp. salt
1 1/2 tsp. caraway seed
1 1/2 tsp. fennel seed
2 tsp. freshly grated orange rind
2 tbsp. vegetable, peanut or canola oil
2 eggs
2 cups rye flour
butter (for brushing)

Stir together 3 cups flour and yeast.

In a saucepan, bring water to a boil with sugar, salt, caraway and
fennel seeds, orange rind and oil; boil for 3 minutes, then remove
from heat. Allow to cool until lukewarm (about 115=B0F).

Gradually add to flour/yeast mixture and knead with electric mixer for
about 2 minutes. Mix in eggs. Add 1 cup flour and knead for 1 minute.

Stir in rye flour and enough of the all purpose flour to make a
moderately stiff dough. If dough is very sticky, add a little more
flour, but try not to add too much flour or the bread will be heavy.
It's easier to add more flour than it is to add more liquid to a dry
dough.

Knead with dough hook for 5 minutes or until dough is smooth and
elastic (8-10 minutes by hand).

Shape into a ball and place in lightly greased bowl, turning to grease
all sides. Cover and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled,
about 1 hour (or however long it takes - this takes more time on cold
or humid days).

Bake in a preheated 400=B0F for 30 to 35 minutes or until done (tap loaf
on bottom and it should sound hollow).

Remove from pans immediately and brush with melted butter.

Note: Half of the white flour can be replaced with white whole wheat
or stone ground whole wheat flour, if desired. Makes a wonderful
Easter or Christmas bread and it was often served in my family on
those holidays.

Makes 2 loaves.
