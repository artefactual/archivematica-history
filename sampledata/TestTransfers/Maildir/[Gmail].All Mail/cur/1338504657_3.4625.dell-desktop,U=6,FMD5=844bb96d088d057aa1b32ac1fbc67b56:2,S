Lemon Poppy Seed Muffins Recipe

   - Prep time: 15 minutes
   - Cook time: 35 minutes

 Add to shopping list
Ingredients

   - 3 cups of all-purpose flour
   - 1 Tbsp baking powder (make sure your baking powder is no older than 6
   months)
   - 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
   - 1/2 teaspoon salt
   - 2 Tbsp poppy seeds


   - 10 Tbsp unsalted butter (1 1/4 stick), softened
   - 1 cup sugar
   - 2 large eggs
   - 1 1/2 cup plain yogurt
   - 1 Tbsp lemon zest

*Glaze*

   - 2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
   - 1 cup confectioner's sugar (powdered sugar)

 Method

*1* Adjust the oven rack to the middle-lower part of the oven. Preheat oven
to 375=B0F.

*2* Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, poppy seeds, and
salt and set aside.

*3* In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar together, beating until
fluffy (about 2 minutes with an electric mixer). Add eggs one at a time,
beating until incorporated after each one. Beat in the lemon zest.

*4* Beat in one third of the dry ingredients until just incorporated. Beat
in one third of the yogurt. Beat in a third more of the dry ingredients.
Beat in a second third of the yogurt. Beat in the remaining dry ingredients
and then the remaining yogurt. Again be careful to beat until just
incorporated. Do not over beat.

*5* Use a standard 12-muffin muffin pan. Coat each muffin cup lightly with
olive oil, grapeseed oil, or a little melted butter using a pastry brush.
Distribute the muffin dough equally among the cups. Bake until muffins are
golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes. Test with a long toothpick (we use a
thin bamboo skewer) to make sure the center of the muffins are done. Set
muffin pan on wire rack to cool. After 5 minutes, remove muffins from pan.

*6* While the muffins are cooling, in a bowl, whisk together the powdered
sugar and lemon juice for the glaze. Add more lemon juice if necessary.
While the muffins are still a bit warm, use a pastry brush to brush the
glaze over each muffin. The muffins will absorb some of the glaze, so you
add more glaze to each muffin if you like.

Best eaten fresh and warm.

*Yield:* Makes 12 muffins.
